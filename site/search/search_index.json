Args: did (str): The DID of the service. task_id (str): The task ID. steps (List[Step]): The steps to create. method create_task create_task(did: str, task: Task, _callback: Optional[Any] = None) Subscribers can create an AI Task for an Agent. The task must contain the input query that will be used by the AI Agent. This method is used by subscribers of a Payment Plan required to access a specific AI Agent or Service. Users who are not subscribers won't be able to create AI Tasks for that Agent. Because only subscribers can create AI Tasks, the method requires the access token to interact with the AI Agent/Service. This is given using the queryOpts object (accessToken attribute).
